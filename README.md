# Tic-Tac-Toe_game

Simple TicTacToe game that can be played by one player and the computer. 
Win is accomplished if there are three Xs'/Os' in a row, column or diagonal.
I made this game to practise dealing with two-dimensional arrays as the board
for the game is a 3x3 matrix.

**Enjoy the game!**
